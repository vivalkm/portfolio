            `This project is an AI-powered knowledge base system that allows users to ask questions via a web application and receive answers based on preloaded private documents. 
            The system leverages various AWS services and large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate and relevant responses. It follows a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
            architecture, where relevant document chunks are first retrieved from a vector database, and then an LLM is used to generate a summarized response based on the retrieved information.`,
